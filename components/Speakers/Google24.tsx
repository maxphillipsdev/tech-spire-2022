        Richard Hofman is a Software Engineer in Google’s enterprise security
        team. He has long held a fascination with privacy and cryptography, and
        holds a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science, from the University of
        Auckland in New Zealand.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his role at Google, Richard’s work mostly encompasses
        cryptographically attested device identity and the infrastructure needed
        to issue and validate credentials based on these identities. He has also
        worked on improving the cryptographic security of SSH traffic at Google.
      </p>
      <p>
        Richard will be speaking about WebAuthn and FIDO2, two closely related,
        privacy-aware standards for online cryptographic authentication. These
        technologies form the basis for “Passkeys”, but are surprisingly broad
        in their own right.
